--== INITIAL WIPI-ANALYZER SLAVE SETUP STEPS ===---

!!! NOTE: Make sure you go through the WiPi-Analyzer-Server setup first before setting up your pi

Connect to your Raspbery Pi username: { pi } password: { raspberry }

sudo raspi-config
-- Choose option 1 { Change User Password } and change your password
-- Choose option 2 { Network Options } and set the hostname to either { wipimonitor-2g } or { wipimonitor-5g } 
		depending on what freq the wipi will be joined to and monitoring
	Note: don't bother setting up the wifi password here, we will do that later with another script
	-Back to Main Menu
-- Choose option 4 { Localisation Options } and set your locale, timezone, and keyboard settings for your region
	-Back to Main Menu
-- Choose option 5 { Interfacing Options } and enable the SSH server [ OPTIONAL ]
	-Back to Main Menu
-- Choose Finish to exit




sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install git

sudo apt-get install nmap

sudo apt-get install php php-curl

sudo apt-get install ifmetric
vim /etc/dhcpcd.conf
	interface wlan0
	metric 200

	interface eth0
	metric 300


sudo apt-get install wavemon
	NOTE: this is a good little tool to mess around with, google it, but optional


---=== SLAVE WIPI MONITORING SCRIPTS INSTALL ===---

Connect your pi to your network via an ethernet connection

cd /home/pi
git init
git pull https://github.com/burton7d8/wipi-analyzer master


sudo vim /home/pi/wifi_info.php
	-- Update the following lines at the top of the page
		$shared_key = "wipi";
		$skip_ssl_checking = "no";
		$wipi_server_url = "https://your_server_domain_or_ip_here/wipi/wipi-analyzer-server/wipi.php";

		- Set $shared_key = "wipi" to match your secret that you set 
			on the server wipi_config.php under $wipi_shared_key = "";
		- Set $skip_ssl_checking = "no"; to "yes", if you are having issues when
			utilizing a self signed certificate 
		- Set $wipi_server_url to match the url or ip address of your SQL server
			NOTE: If you choose to not use ssl, then set it to http://  
				Using SSL is HIGHLY recommended, otherwise your shared key
				will be transfered unencrypted, leaving you exposed
				- if using userspice, you will also have to turn off "force ssl" under
					site setings, if not using ssl

--NOTE: the next two commands are optional, this will auto prompt you if you want to update
	the wifi settings whenever you login to the pi, so that you can easily change to another ssid

sudo vim /home/pi/.bashrc
sudo /bin/bash /home/pi/wificonfig.sh



mkdir /home/pi/logs

sudo vim /etc/logrotate.conf
:set mouse-=a
:set paste
--paste the following at the end of the file
/home/pi/logs/*.log {
        daily
        missingok
        rotate 7
        notifempty
}

-- Setup your wireless network you want to join
	NOTE: remember to join either your 2g or 5g SSID based on the hostname you set on the pi
	-- if both of your pi's are pi 3's then you may have to set your 5g SSID with a -5g on the 
		end to be able to tell the difference, otherwise you can use an older pi model
		that only supports 2.4ghz to act as your 2.4ghz wipi monitor

cd /home/pi
./wificonfig.sh

iwconfig
--If  this line 
		wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:YOUR_SSID
	-shows you connected to your ssid AND
ifconfig
	-shows you having an IP from the SSID you joined

Then you are ready to add the following to the crontab and let the wipi start monitoring and sending data

*** ADD to root crontab
sudo su -
crontab -e
*/1 * * * * sudo /usr/bin/php /home/pi/wifi_info.php >/dev/null 2>&1
:x


ENJOY! Hope you find this thrown together mess usefull!  

( Also, dont make fun of my code, I'm self taught and lazy sometimes 
	just correct it and send it my way so I can learn )
